      <h2>Work In Progress</h2>
      <div>
        This tool is extremely limited and incomplete. It is not going
        to work correctly (e.g. it will consider any variable a signed
        integer), if it works at all (almost all language constructs
        are not supported). As such this documentation is more
        academic in nature, and should not be considered a user manual
        yet.
      </div>

      <div>
        This tool is planned to translate programs written in MATLAB
        or Octave to a
        <a href="http://cprover.diffblue.com/background-concepts.html">GOTO
          symbol table</a>, and then using the <tt>cbmc</tt> tool from
          the <a href="https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc">CPROVER</a>
          tool-chain, and
          the <a href="https://github.com/CVC4/cvc4">CVC4 SMT
          Solver</a> to perform analysis. The results will then be
          picked up by <tt>mh_bmc</tt> and translated back to the
          original MATLAB or Octave source code.

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <div>
        MH BMC has the following additional requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>It only works on Linux right now</li>
          <li>It requires the following tools from CPROVER on your PATH
            <ul>
              <li><tt>cbmc</tt></li>
              <li><tt>symtab2gb</tt></li>
              <li><tt>goto-instrument</tt></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <div>
        Currently almost nothing works, and many sweeping assumptions
        are made:
        <ul>
          <li>Everything is considered a 32-bit signed integer</li>
          <li>Nothing beyond a tiny set of operations work</li>
          <li>Only functions returning exactly one value work</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
