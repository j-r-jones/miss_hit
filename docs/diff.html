      <h2>Work In Progress</h2>
      <div>
        This tool is work in progress, but should work well enough to
        be used. However please do not yet rely on its output or
        completeness to identify all parts of a changed model in
        safety related contexts.

	Specifically only <i>MATLAB code blocks</i> are considered,
	any other change in the model is <i>ignored</i>.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <div>
        The intended way to use this tool is through <tt>git
          difftool</tt>. For example:
	<pre>git difftool HEAD^ -yx mh_diff Potato.slx</pre>

	If you
	have <a href="https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdiff3">KDiff3</a>
	installed, you can also use the <tt>--kdiff3</tt> option to
	show a graphical diff:
	<pre>git difftool HEAD^ -yx "mh_diff --kdiff3" Potato.slx</pre>

	It is possible to use the tool directly; in which case two
	arguments must be supplied: two files to diff. For example:
	<pre>mh_diff --kdiff3 Basic_Potato.slx Custom_Potato.slx</pre>
      </div>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
	    The key limitation is that only MATLAB code blocks are
            considered. All other differences in the model are ignored.
	  </li>
          <li>
	    Renamed blocks are not dealt with correctly (they are
	    shown as 2 diffs, a removed block and an added block).
	  </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
