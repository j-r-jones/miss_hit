    <div class="section">
      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a small utility to
      help maintain copyright notices in your codebase
      (<span class="file">mh_copyright</span>).
    </div>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <div>
        This tool aims assist developers with some common but annoying
        maintenance tasks relating to copyright notices in large
        projects. A simple search and replace is often not actually
        that simple, or changes something in e.g. a string that should
        not be changed. MH Copyright can perform some of these tasks
        for you.
      </div>

      <div>
        Note: this tool <b>must not</b> be run in CI. It is a tool
        that assists you in one-off tasks, that must be reviewed (as
        copyright notices are generally considered to be important
        things).
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <div>
        The tool is configured and run from the command-line. It does
        respect the usual MISS_HIT configuration files: in directories
        where MISS_HIT is disabled, or directories that are excluded
        no changes are made. If you want to just consider all files,
        then use the <tt>--ignore-config</tt> common to all MISS_HIT
        tools.
      </div>

      <div>
        The general usage is this:

        <pre>$ mh_copyright ACTION {OPTION} [FILES|DIRS]</pre>

        At least one action must be specified, and most likely you
        will want to provide one or more options.
      </div>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <div>
        The following options are specific to MH Copyright.
      </div>

      <h4>--primary-entity</h4>
      <div>
        Defines the (primary) copyright holder. Depending on the
        action this has different effects. For example for the update
        year action, this identifies which notice to change; but for
        the change entity action this identifies what the final result
        should be.
      </div>

      <div>
        If you use a configuration file, then MH Copyright will use
        the <tt>copyright_primary_entity</tt> if set,
        or <tt>copyright_entity</tt> set, if there is precisely one.
      </div>

      <h4>--year</h4>
      <div>
        Defines the year to which copyright notices should be updated
        to. By default this is the current year.
      </div>

      <h4>--template</h4>
      <div>
        A string that will be used to create new or modify existing
        copyright notices with a single year. By default this matches
        the <tt>copyright_regex</tt>. We highly recommend to never
        change or touch this. By default this is:
        <pre>%(copy)s %(yend)u %(org)s</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>--template-range</h4>
      <div>
        A string that will be used to create new or modify existing
        copyright notices with a year range. By default this matches
        the <tt>copyright_regex</tt>. We highly recommend to never
        change or touch this. By default this is:
        <pre>%(copy)s %(ystart)-%(yend)u %(org)s</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>--style</h4>
      <div>
        When <i>adding</i> a new copyright notice, then this flag
        determines if we start the notice with "(c) Copyright" or
        "Copyright (c)". There are three choices:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>dynamic</b> - The default. Choses c_last for code
            where Octave mode is enabled, and c_last otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>c_first</b> - Always chooses "(c) Copyright".
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>c_last</b> - Always chooses "Copyright (c)".
          </li>
        </ul>
        Note this setting has no effect if a notice is <i>changed</i>:
        there we always keep the existing style (i.e. we use whatever
        is matched in the copy subgroup of the copyright regex).
      </div>

      <h3>Actions</h3>
      <div>
        Note that only a single action can be performed. If you want
        to do more, just invoke the tool twice.
      </div>

      <h4>--update-year</h4>
      <div>
	Updates the year for the primary copyright holder. For example
	it might change this notice
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 2020 Potato Inc.
% (c) Copyright 2020 Florian Schanda
% (c) Copyright 2010-2019 ACME GmbH
</pre>
        To this:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 2020 Potato Inc.
% (c) Copyright 2020-2021 Florian Schanda
% (c) Copyright 2010-2019 ACME GmbH
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>--change-entity=OLD_ENTITY</h4>
      <div>
        Replaces the old entity with the primary copyright
        holder. Leaves year ranges unchanged. For example:

<pre>
% (c) Copyright 1998-2020 Old Company GmbH
</pre>
        Will be changed to this:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 1998-2020 New Company GmbH
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>--merge</h4>
      <div>
        A more complex operation that merged multiple copyright
        notices into a single one that spans the entire range of all
        merged entities. The use case here is a company renaming
        itself multiple times; and nobody having updated notices.
      </div>

      <div>
        All <tt>copyright_entity</tt> entries from the configuration
        are considered as candidates, except
        for <tt>copyright_3rd_party_entity</tt>. All <tt>copyright_entity</tt>
        entries will be rewritten to the primary copyright entity.
      </div>

      <div>
        For example consider this <tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt> file:
<pre>
copyright_entity: "Florian Schanda"
copyright_entity: "Potato GmbH"
copyright_entity: "Kitten GmbH"
copyright_3rd_party_entity: "Feature not a Bug Consulting Inc."
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        And now consider this set of copyright notices:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 2020 Potato GmbH
% (c) Copyright 1998-1999 Feature not a Bug Consulting Inc.
% (c) Copyright 2021 Florian Schanda
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        If we run the tool, setting the primary copyright holder to
        "Florian Schanda", we should get this:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 1998-1999 Feature not a Bug Consulting Inc.
% (c) Copyright 2020-2021 Florian Schanda
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>--add-notice</h4>
      <div>
        Adds a new copyright notice with the current year and primary
        copyright holder to files without a notice. We do not attempt
        to insert this into the docstring (if any) of the primary
        entity, but instead this notice is added to the top of the
        file (or at the end of the file docstring, if it exists).
      </div>

      <div>
        Please take <b>special care</b> when using this option, and
        very carefully <b>review</b>; as adding copyright notices to
        files that you cannot claim copyright over might have
        interesting legal implications later on.
