  <main>
    <div class="section">
      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a simple style
      checker (<span class="file">mh_style</span>). It can detect
      and correct (when the --fix options given) a number of coding
      style issues, most of which are configurable.
    </div>

    <div class="title">

    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Using MISS_HIT Style</h2>
      <div>
        The easiest way to use the style checker is to just invoke it
        on the command-line:
      </div>

      <div>
        To analyse one or more files:

        <pre>$ mh_style my_file.m</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        It is possible to also style-check and fix code embedded
        inside Simulink&reg; models. To do you need to use a special
        command-line flag. Once the feature is stable enough, this
        flag will be removed.

        <pre>$ mh_style --process-slx --fix my_model.slx</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        To analyse all files in a directory tree:
        <pre>$ mh_style src/</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        To analyse all files in the current directory tree:
        <pre>$ mh_style</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Setting up configuration in your project (a worked example)</h3>
      <div>
        However, it is very likely that you do not like all default
        options. MISS_HIT can be configured for projects using
        configuration files which must be
        named <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span>
        (or <span class="file">.miss_hit</span>, this alternative
        exists for people who do not want to have them visible).
      </div>

      <div>
        The configuration system is based on inheriting options. This
        is best explained by example. Lets say we have a project that
        has the following structure:
<pre>
foo/
foo/foo_main.m
foo/lib/potato.m
foo/lib/kitten.m
foo/external/some_toolkit.m
</pre>
        We have a main program, some library code, but we also use an
        external toolkit that we've included for convenience.
      </div>

      <div>
        Lets say we want to configure a tab-width of 8 for our
        project. We then place a new file in the tree at
        <span class="file">foo/miss_hit.cfg</span> that contains the
        following:
        <pre>tab_width: 8</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        However, now we get tons of warnings for the external tool-kit
        if we just run miss_hit in the project root. We can exclude
        this directory by adding the following to our config file:
        <pre>exclude_dir: "external"</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Finally, we want to relax the line length to 120 characters
        for our library, but not for anything else. To do this we
        create another config file
        in <span class="file">foo/lib/miss_hit.cfg and</span> write:

        <pre>line_length: 120</pre>

        Note that we do not have to repeat the tab-width, this setting
        is inherited from <span class="file">foo/miss_hit.cfg</span>.
      </div>

      <div>
        Our tree now looks like this:
<pre>
foo/
foo/miss_hit.cfg
foo/foo_main.m
foo/lib/miss_hit.cfg
foo/lib/potato.m
foo/lib/kitten.m
foo/external/some_toolkit.m
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Now, when running the style checker on a file or directory the
        correct settings are automatically applied, using the entire
        tree of configuration.
      </div>

      <h3>Configuration on the command-line</h3>

      <div>
        Some options (like line length) can also be configured on the
        command-line. Command-line options are intended to be
        temporary, and they take precedence over any options specified
        in config files.
      </div>

      <div>
        Options are usually read from configuration
        files <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span>. This behaviour
        can be disabled entirely with the --ignore-config option.
      </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Configuration file syntax reference</h2>
      <div>
        In general the config files follow a simply sytax:
        <pre>key: value</pre> The key is some identifier like
        tab_width, and the value is the configuration for that
        key. Integers are written directly, and strings are enclosed
        in double quotes. Comments start with #.
      </div>

      <h3>Enable/disable analysis ("enable")</h3>

      <div>
        A special entry "enable" into
        a <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span> can be used to enable
        or disable analysis for the subtree.
      </div>

      <div>
        For example if you have a lot of legacy code you can put this
        into your root configuration:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
enable: 0
line_length: 100
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        And then enable analysis for some subdirectories, e.g. in
        <span class="file">foo/new_code/miss_hit.cfg</span> you can
        write:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
enable: 1
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Like any other option, the "closest one" takes
        precedence. Specifically this means you can disable for a
        large tree, and enable again for specific sub-trees.
      </div>

      <h3>Excluding directories ("exclude_dir")</h3>

      <div>
        You can also specify the special "exclude_dir" property in
        configuration files. This property must name a directory
        directly inside (i.e. you can't
        specify <span class="file">foo/bar</span>) the same directory
        the configuration file resides in. This is especially useful
        when including an external repository, over which we have
        limited control.
      </div>

      <div>
        This is a much more drastic option that "enable: 0", since
        this permanently excludes a tree from analysis. It cannot be
        turned on again since the tool will never search excluded
        directories.
      </div>

      <div>
        Below is given a more realistic root configuration:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
file_length: 1000
line_length: 120
copyright_entity: "Potato Inc."

# We include the delightful
# miss_hit tools in our repo,
# but don't want to accidentally
# check their weird test cases
exclude_dir: "miss_hit"
</pre>
      </div>
    </section>

    <div class="title">
      <img src="assets/check-square.svg" alt="Justifications" />
      <h1>Justifications</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        Style issues can be justified by placing "mh:ignore_style"
        into a comment or line continuation. The justification applies
        to all style issues on that line. Please refer
        to <a href="pragmas.html">MISS_HIT Pragmas</a> for a full
        description of all pragmas understood by MISS_HIT.
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
% we normally get a message
% about no whitespace
% surrounding the =
x=5; % mh:ignore_style
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Justifications that are useless generate a warning.

    <div class="title">
      <img src="assets/edit.svg" alt="Style Rules" />
      <h1>Style Rules</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        There are three types of rules:
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Mandatory rules</b>: they are always active and can be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Autofix rules</b>: they are optional and can be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
          <li><b>Rules</b>: they are optional and cannot be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        Rules with a name (for example "whitespace_keywords") can be
        individually suppressed in or re-enabled in configuration files. For
        example:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
suppress_rule: "operator_whitespace"
enable_rule: "file_length"
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        By default all rules are active.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mandatory rules</h2>
      <div>
        These rules are always active. The technical reason for this is
        that it would be too difficult to autofix issues without
        autofixing these. If you pay me an excessive amount of money I
        could look into this but I'd rather keep the lexer vaguely
        sane. All of them are automatically fixed
        by <span class="file">mh_style</span> when the --fix option
        is specified.
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: MANDATORY RULES -->
      <h4>Trailing newlines at end of file</h4>
      <div>
        This mandatory rule makes sure there is a single trailing newline
        at the end of a file.
      </div>

      <h4>Consecutive blank lines</h4>
      <div>
        This rule allows a maximum of one blank line to separate code blocks.
        Comments are not considered blank lines.
      </div>

      <h4>Use of tab</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces the absence of the tabulation character
        *everywhere*. When auto-fixing, a tab-width of 4 is used by default,
        but this can be configured with the options &#x27;tab_width&#x27;.
      </div>

      <div>
        Note that the fix replaces the tab everywhere, including in strings
        literals. This means
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
&quot;a&lt;tab&gt;b&quot;
   &quot;a&lt;tab&gt;b&quot;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        might be fixed to
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
&quot;a        b&quot;
   &quot;a     b&quot;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Which may or may not what you had intended originally. I am not sure
        if this is a bug or a feature, but either way it would be *painful* to
        change so I am going to leave this as is.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>tab_width</b>: Tab-width, by default 4.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Trailing whitespace</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces that there is no trailing whitespace in your files.
        You *really* want to do this, even if the MATLAB default editor makes
        this really hard. The reason is that it minimises conflicts when using
        modern version control systems.
      </div>

      <!-- END HOOK: MANDATORY RULES -->

      <h4>Newlines</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces consistent newlines in your files, with the
        default being your platform's newlines.
      </div>
      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>newline_style</b>: <tt>"native"</tt> (the
            default), <tt>"lf"</tt>, <tt>"crlf"</tt>, or <tt>"cr"</tt>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        It is strongly advised to not change this, and instead
        configure <tt>git</tt> correctly to deal with this problem.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Autofix rules</h2>
      <div>
        The following rules are automatically fixed
        by <span class="file">mh_style</span> when the --fix option
        is specified.
      </div>

      <h4>File should not start with whitespace ("no_starting_newline")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure the first line in a file is not whitespace.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding commas ("whitespace_comma")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after commas, and no whitespace
        before commas, e.g. 'foo, bar, baz'.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding semicolons ("whitespace_semicolon")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after semicolons, and no whitespace
        before semicolons, e.g. 'x = [foo; bar; baz]'.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding colon ("whitespace_colon")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces no whitespace around colons, except after
        commas.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around assignment ("whitespace_assignment")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace around the assignment operation
        (=).
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding brackets ("whitespace_brackets")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after square and round brackets,
        and no whitespace before their closing counterpart. For
        example: [foo, bar]
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace after some words ("whitespace_keywords")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is whitespace after some words such
        as "if" or "properties".
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace in comments ("whitespace_comments")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is some whitespace between the
        comment character (%) and the rest of the comment. The exception
        is "divisor" comments like "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%" and the pragmas such
        as "%#codegen".
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace in continuation ("whitespace_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is some whitespace between the last
        thing on a line and a line continuation.
      </div>

      <h4>Continuations followed by terminators ("useless_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule flags up line continuations that are followed by
        things that would end the statement anyway. For example:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
if potato ...

    x = 1;
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Dangerously misleading continuations ("dangerous_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule identifies continuations that are one code change
        away from introducing difficult to find bugs. In the MATLAB
        and Octave language statements are usually terminated by a ;
        and a newline, but there are a few places where nothing is
        required. Consider this example:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
if potato ...
    if kitten
        x = 1;
    end
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Since the expression for the if-guard does not need
        termination, the continuation here just happens to work. This
        rule removes these continuations (or replaces them with
        comments).
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around operators ("operator_whitespace")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure binary operators (except for the power
        operators) are surrounded by whitespace, and unary operators
        are not followed by whitespace. Like so:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
x = -foo + bar;
y = x^2;
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around functions ("whitespace_around_functions")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure functions (including nested functions and
        class methods) are surrounded by whitespace. In other words:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 2020 Florian Schanda
function Test_05
    x = 12;
    % This is a function
    function Potato
        disp(x);
    end
    Potato;
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Is changed to this:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 2020 Florian Schanda
function Test_05
    x = 12;

    % This is a function
    function Potato
        disp(x);
    end

    Potato;
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This also works for functions without the end keyword.
      </div>

      <h4>Consistent semicolons ("end_of_statements")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces consistent statement terminators. It
        effectively bans commas and requires semicolons + newline at
        the end of most statements. The exceptions are things like
        'return' or the end of compound statements such as 'if'.
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
x = y, y = z;   % commas not allowed
x = y; y = z;;  % newline required, and spurious semicolon
if foo;         % useless semicolon
   disp hello   % missing semicolon
end;            % useless semicolon
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        All of these issues can be auto-fixed, if the indentation rule
        is enabled. Otherwise only the subset of issues that does not
        require adding newlines can be fixed.
      </div>

      <h4>Indentation ("indentation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces consistent indentation and line
        continuations. It fixes indentation, but leaves the exact
        amount of extra whitespace added for continuations untouched
        (for now).
      </div>

      <div>
        While indentation is usually a popular religious flame-war
        topic, for the MATLAB language there is not so much room for
        creativity. The main reason for this is that the language
        lacks brackets for blocks. If you do feel that you have a
        specific indentation style that is not catered for here please
        raise an issue and I will see what I can do. For now there is
        just one style.
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
if potato
    disp (['Hello', ...
           ' World!']);
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        In the above example there is no indentation for the if since
        it is the top-level statement in a script. The call to disp is
        indented, since it is part of a compound statement. The
        continuation is indented to the level of the opening square
        bracket.
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
x = some + ...
   expression;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        The continuation in the above example is offset 3 spaces, and
        this offset will be preserved. If you change the setting of
        tab_width at any point, this means that the continuation is
        still properly aligned as chosen by the programmer.
      </div>

      <div>
        The following constructs cause indentation:
        <ul>
          <li>Any compound statements (e.g. if, switch, etc.)</li>
          <li>Function and class definitions</li>
          <li>The four special blocks (properties, methods,
            enumeration, or events) inside classes</li>
          <li>The argument validation block for functions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>tab_width</b>: Indent by this many spaces. By default
            this is 4.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>indent_function_file_body</b>: Indent the body of the
            top-level functions in a function file. By default this is
            true. What you get with this is sensibly and consistently
            indented code. If you set it to false, then you get the
            odd convention of NOT indenting the function body, which
            appears to be somewhat common in the MATLAB world. This
            only applies to functions in function files. Functions in
            e.g. classes are always indented normally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>align_round_brackets</b>: Align continuations inside
            normal brackets to the opening brace. By default this is
            true.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>align_other_brackets</b>: Align continuations inside
            matrix or cell expressions to the opening brace. By
            default this is true.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Redundant brackets ("redundant_brackets")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces removes some brackets that are clearly
        useless: top-level brackets and double brackets. Brackets that
        have been added to clarify operator precedence are not
        touched.
      </div>

      <div>
        This is an example of redundant brackets:
<pre>
if (potato)
    x = ((x + 1));
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This set of brackets are technically redundant due to operator
        precedence, but they are left alone since they were probably
        added for clarity:
<pre>
  x = (a * b) + (b * c);
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Spurious commas inside cells and rows ("spurious_row_comma")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule complains about unnecessary commas inside matrix and
        cell expressions. Specifically, both of these mean the same
        thing, but the trailing and starting comma for <tt>a</tt>
        and <tt>b</tt> respectively are spurious.
<pre>
a = [1, 2,];
b = [, 1, 2];
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>
	Spurious semicolons inside cells and rows ("spurious_row_semicolon")
      </h4>

      <div>
        This rule complains about unnecessary semicolons inside matrix
        and cell expressions. For example here the semicolon in the
        first row is useless, because the newline also introduces a
        new row.
<pre>
a = [1, 0;
     0, 1];
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Annotation whitespace ("annotation_whitespace")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after the annotation indication,
        i.e. we we make sure things look like this:
        <pre>%| pragma Potato;</pre>
      </div>

      <!--
      <h4>Implicit short-circuit operations ("implicit_shortcircuit")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule make sure that when logical operations & and | are
        not used in if/while
        guards. The <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/logicaloperatorsshortcircuit.html">semantics
        of the MATLAB language are confusing here</a> in that in those contexts &
        behaves like &&, and | behaves like ||.

        <pre>if a & b</pre>

        In this example b will never be evaluated if a evaluates to
        false. Compare this with:

        <pre>tmp = a & b; if tmp</pre>

        In this example b will always be evaluated. This rule
        auto-fixes the implicit short-circuit operations to be
        explicit.

      <h4>Copyright notice ("copyright_notice")</h4>

      <div>
        This rules looks for a copyright notice (by default in the
        docstring of the primary entity). The list of acceptable
        copyright holders can be configured with
        copyright_entity. This option can be given more than once to
        permit a set of valid copyright holders. If this options is
        not set, the rule just looks for any copyright notice.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_location</b>: The desired format for
            copyright notices. This can take one of the following
            values:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <i>docstring</i> - The default. Search the primary
                function, class, or script docstring for copyright
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>file_header</i> - Look only at the first line in
                each file.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_primary_entity</b>: Can be specified only
            once, multiple uses of this override each other. This is
            supposed to be the key copyright holder. This setting is
            the same as below for the style checker, but has special
            significance for the <a href="copyright.html">MH
            Copyright</a> tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_entity</b>: Can be specified more than
            once. Make sure each copyright notice mentions one of
            these. These should all be your legal entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_3rd_party_entity</b>: Can be specified more
            than once. These are other copyright holders (e.g. for
            other code that you have integrated into your
            project). For the style checker this has no special
            meaning (it means the same as above), but the copyright
            utility treats these differently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_in_embedded_code</b>: Normally this rule is
            not enabled on MATLAB code embedded in Simulink&reg;
            models, since most models carry their copyright notice
            elsewhere. This flag can be used to turn on this rule for
            embedded code tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_regex</b>: The magic regex to detect
            copyright and years. I very <strong>strongly</strong>
            suggest that you do not change this. If you absolutely
            must have a different notice than the default, then the
            regex must include at least these named groups: copy,
            ystart, yend, and org.

            The default is the highly readable:
            <pre>(?P&lt;copy&gt;(Copyright \([cC]\))|((\([cC]\) )?Copyright)) +((?P&lt;ystart&gt;\d\d\d\d)(-| - ))?(?P&lt;yend&gt;\d\d\d\d)( by)? *(?P&lt;org&gt;.*)</pre>

            Again, please do not change this. Right now the tools
            don't validate this and you will get strange behaviour if
            you mess this up. Please. Just don't.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        For example, an acceptable copyright notice using the docstring
        approach looks like this:
<pre>
function rv = Byte_Add_One(x)
    % BYTE_ADD_ONE This adds one to the input
    %   Note: on overflow, it saturates
    %
    %   (c) Copyright 2021 Florian Schanda

    rv = x;
    if x < 255
        rv = rv + 1;
    end
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        With the <tt>file_header</tt> approach, our notice should look
        like this:
<pre>
% (c) Copyright 2021 Florian Schanda

function rv = Byte_Add_One(x)
    % BYTE_ADD_ONE This adds one to the input
    %   Note: on overflow, it saturates

    rv = x;
    if x < 255
        rv = rv + 1;
    end
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Note that if a function or class does not contain a docstring,
        then we look at the docstring of the file instead, so
        generally speaking the <tt>docstring</tt> setting is a
        superset of, and compatible with, the <tt>file_header</tt>
        setting. However, if your file has a copyright notices in
        *both* the file header and the primary function or class, then
        this is not accepted.
      </div>

      <h4>Naming scheme for classes ("naming_classes")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming for all user-defined
        classes.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_class_name</b>: A regular expression that every
            class must match. By default it is:
            <pre>([A-Z]+|[A-Z][a-z]*)(_([A-Z]+|[A-Z][a-z]*|[0-9]+))*</pre>
            This regular expression encodes the "Ada" naming scheme
            which is in my opinion probably the most descriptive and
            consistent naming scheme. It requires underscore-separated
            acronyms or capitalised words. Good class names under this
            scheme are:
            <ul>
              <li>Kitten_Class</li>
              <li>LASER</li>
              <li>OS_Monitor</li>
            </ul>
            Bad names are:
            <ul>
              <li>PotatoFarmer (no underscore)</li>
              <li>hamster_Monitor (not capitalised)</li>
              <li>LASERActuator (no underscore)</li>
              <li>Sharks_ (trailing underscore)</li>
              <li>Bad__Name (double underscore)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Naming scheme for functions ("naming_functions")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming for all user-defined
        functions and methods.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_function_name</b>: A regular expression that
            every ordinary function must match. The default is the
            same as it is for classes. (See above.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>regex_nested_name</b>: A regular expression that every
            nested function must match. The default is the same as it
            is for classes. (See above.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>regex_method_name</b>: A regular expression that
            every class method must match. The default is
            <pre>[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*</pre> This is all lower-case,
            underscore separated names.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Naming scheme for scripts ("naming_scripts")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming for all script
        files. Note that function files and class files are not
        covered by this rule, only pure script files.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_script_name</b>: A regular expression that every
            script file (without <tt>.m</tt> extension) must
            match. The default is the same as it is for classes. (See
            above.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Naming scheme for parameters ("naming_parameters")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming for input and output
        parameters of functions and methods.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_parameter_name</b>: A regular expression that
            every parameter must match. The default all lower-case
            with underscores.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Naming scheme for parameters ("naming_enumerations")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming enumerations in a class
        definition.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_enumeration_name</b>: A regular expression that
            every enumeration must match. The default is the same as
            for classes. (See above.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Non-ASCII characters in source ("unicode")</h4>
      <div>
	This rule enforces source files to only contain ASCII
	characters. This is generally a good idea, because allowing
	non-ascii characters creates all sorts of annoying portability
	issues.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>enforce_encoding</b>: A string that can
            be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings">any
            valid Python encoding</a> to enforce. By default this is
            "ASCII".
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>enforce_encoding_comments</b>: A boolean, by default
            true. This controls if the rule also checks comments and
            continuations, not just program text.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        Note: currently nothing can be auto-fixed here, but I plan to
        add support to automatically convert from one valid encoding
        to another. However even then, characters that are outside the
        valid set will never be auto-fixed (e.g: it is impossible to
        decide if &auml; should be translated as a or ae or something
        else entirely).
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: RULES -->
      <h4>Maximum file length ("file_length")</h4>
      <div>
        This is configurable with &#x27;file_length&#x27;. It is a good idea to keep
        the length of your files under some limit since it forces your
        project into avoiding the worst spaghetti code.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>file_length</b>: Maximum lines in a file, 1000 by default.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Max characters per line ("line_length")</h4>
      <div>
        This is configurable with &#x27;line_length&#x27;, default is 80. It is a
        good idea for readability to avoid overly long lines. This can help
        you avoid extreme levels of nesting and avoids having to scroll
        around.
